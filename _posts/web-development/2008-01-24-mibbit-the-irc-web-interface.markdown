A friend was looking through <a href="http://ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> and found <a href="http://www.mibbit.com/">Mibbit</a>, a recent IRC web application in the world of AJAX.  Remarkable things: /whois command, the smilies, tab completion for nicknames, typing notification, auto-away feature, and more.

The idea is nothing original, what is interesting is the execution of the idea. In my opinion, Mibbit is a lot more attractive to the common Java chat interface, and it seems an embedded version of the client will be available in alpha soon! You can read more about Mibbit, in the <a href="http://mibbit.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. 

I wonder if the <a href="http://axod.blogspot.com/">developer</a> of Mibbit will provide some way to customize the interface, and extend the standard functionality of IRC beyond chat, and private messages. I can imagine a plugin that allows file transfers from 1 user to all, or between users; for example.
