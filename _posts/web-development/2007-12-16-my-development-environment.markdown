Some of my comrades at work look at me in awe (alright, more like with a "WTF? are you insane" stare) when I tell them that my preferred php ide is <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a> (plus one of the <a href="http://www.proggyfonts.com/">proggy fonts</a>).  I do use gVim too, when I'm on debian (with fluxbox!).

I wonder, is that really unusual? xD

If I couple my tabbed Notepad++ interface with 2 or 3 explorer windows, I have all I need for web development.  I don't think I have to mention Firefox, and all the incredible extensions available. I really <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">don't</a>. <a href="http://superiocity.com/blog/view/PHP-Web-Development-Tools">This post</a> mentions some of the essential Firefox add-ons, and some that I didn't know at the time I read it.

I know that Zend Studio, APtana, PHP Designer, or PHP Eclipse (this has a specific name I don't remember), are one of the tools I should be using according to the majority of my fellow programmers.  However, all I want is syntax coloring, and perhaps a debugger.  So yeah, I'm looking for a minimalist editor that provides debugging facilities for PHP. xD
