By no means complete. And that is fine.

<h2>Changes and justifications</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Improve navigation. Previously, there was no explicit navigation options.</li>
        <li>Attempt to reduce bounce rate by increasing the size of display for the categories and recent articles lists.  That is, if a visitor comes to the front page, her next click should be to an on-site link.  I write for myself, but is interesting to see if the changes I did affect this rate.</li>
 <li>Added some colors to try to make the theme less boring and provide easy identification of content zones.</li>
<li>Added random quotes.  A feature requested by the client (that would be me). Let's see if there are some refreshs. xD</li>
</ol>

<h2>Previous versions</h2>

So far, the only thing I'm sure of, is that I will be changing the design in 1 to 3 months from now.  I like it how it is now. About 90% complete. But that missing 10% will be the most painful.
