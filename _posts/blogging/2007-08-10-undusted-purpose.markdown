The initial purpose of having a blog was twofold: to learn how to write properly, and to create references of interesting information. Effectively, creating a knowledge base for future use.

After I year of no activity, I feel the urge to continue this quest motivated by the need to keep myself current with everything that is happening (so fast by the way).  That's the why of this blog's title. It is terrible easy to be outdated. (X_X)

<h2>Clean Purpose</h2>
The purpose is no different from the old one. Just more specific. This blog is and will be about web development, personal coding projects, interesting things not necessarily related to the web and, on occasion, some personal bits. 

Of course, it will not be limited to that. However, I have some content that I want to write about that will be on another site. (n_n) 

There will be articles in spanish and english. Why not? (^_^)

It was fun re-reading my old posts. Certainly, it will be next time. For now, let's see how much time I last on this writing spree. (^o^)
