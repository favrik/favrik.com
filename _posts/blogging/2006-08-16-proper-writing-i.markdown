One of my goals, by having this site,  is to learn how to write proper english.  It's my second language, and it's specially dear to me, because most of the things I've learned that have shapen the way I am, my work and my process, were written in english.  It really is an awesome language to grasp the meaning/message of text since, as a basic comparison, you can get the idea in less words than if it were written in spanish (for example).  

I'm starting with <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/StyleGuide/">The Economist Style Guide</a>.  My first area of focus is punctuation.  Major missunderstanding I have is with the semicolon (";"). 

<a href="http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=805705">Semi-colons</a>
Semi-colons should be used to mark a pause longer than a comma and shorter than a full stop. Don't overdo them.


A "fun" and interesting exercise would be to go through my posts and fix the errors. >.>
