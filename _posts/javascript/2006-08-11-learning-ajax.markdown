<strong>Why did you decide to learn AJAX?</strong> For the hype, I guess. It just popped out everywhere, and I got this old application (in JSP) with some serious design problems (which when you make an app in just a weekend as part of school homework, but that will be used to solve a real problem, it's pretty obvious that there will be not problems but nightmares...) needing solving ASAP (red flag warning). 

I remember some years ago watching a XMLHttpRequest demo:  the <a href="http://www.objectgraph.com/dictionary/">object graph dictionary</a>. And I said: "Nice, looks cool".  Then, at some point in the space-time dimension (I need to do something about my memory problems...sigh) <a href="http://maps.google.com/">google maps</a> came out. My impression: Wow! But that was it.  Still didn't knew much about why using AJAX was a good thing (tm) and I did not see a need to use that kind of stuff in the applications I was working on.

So back to the old application, and the hype!, as usual I started a search on guess what?  Google of course. (I'm conviced that in the near future we are only going to need water and google to live >.>). Here are some interesting results and why are they interesting (in an almost accurate browsing order):

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/06/26/libraries">Notes on JavaScript Libraries</a>. This was what re-started my interest. Now AJAX is cool, but learning Javascript the right way (tm) is pleasing.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html">Developer Notes for prototype.js</a>. You gotta start somewhere, so I choosed <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>.  Tyvm Sergio! :D</li>

	


	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX on WikiPedia</a>.  Thanks for providing pros and cons.  It turns out not all is hype!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a>. Summary: a showcase of applications using this technique, a resources section, complemented with some interesting articles, and checkout the podcast, and, and...</li>
	<li><a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">AJAX Patterns</a>. Heh, I have the books: Design Patterns, and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.  Guess I'm gonna like this.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.farleyfamily.net/school/project/">Introduction to AJAX and Web 2.0 - Web Database Project</a>. Impressive. A big thanks for sharing this! This should be your first stop if you are trying to get what is AJAX all about imho.</li>


	<li><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/12/the_ajax_respon.html">The AJAX response: XML, HTML, or JSON?</a>. I thought simple html snippets were enough; it's all about context in this case.</li>
	<li><a href="http://24ways.org/advent/have-your-dom-and-script-it-too">Have Your DOM and Script It Too</a>. Just after reading the previous article.</li>
</ul>

I'm using prototype, and html snippets as the response.  Let's see what happens.  I'll update this to reflect any change or recommendation.  Experience, my favorite teacher. I sense that redesigning the User Interface will be the most challenging problem, so integrating AJAX should be easy?
