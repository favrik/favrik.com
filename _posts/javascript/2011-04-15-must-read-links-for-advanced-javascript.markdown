Currently, [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is big.  If you have recently learned about it or already have worked on it and find that you are loving it; you will probably arrive to a situation where you need to create a BIG Javascript application.

Unfortunately for you, there are no online tutorials or resources to help you on this quest.  Well, at least not many.

So, I've compiled a list of what I consider essential reading if you are interested in the topics of Advanced Javascript or BIG Javascript applications.  They are more intended as food for thought and inspiration.

## Rebecca Murphey [adventures in javascript](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/)

A great read in general, articles covering Advanced Javascript:

1. [On jQuery & Large Applications](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/on-jquery-large-applications)
2. [On Rolling Your Own](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/on-rolling-your-own)
3. [Code Org, Take 2: Structuring JavaScript Applications](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/code-org-take-2-structuring-javascript-applic)
4. [When you're building a non-trivial JS application ...](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/when-youre-building-a-non-trivial-js-applicat)
5. [Modern JavaScrip](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/modern-javascript)


## Peter Michaux [peter.michaux.ca](http://peter.michaux.ca)

A great read too, highlighted articles are:

1. [MVC Architecture for JavaScript Applications](http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/mvc-architecture-for-javascript-applications)
2. [MVC To-do Application](http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/mvc-to-do-application)

## RightJS [JavaScript Framework That Feels Right](http://rightjs.org/)

Very interesting alternative to jQuery/Prototype/Dojo/etc. Do take a look at the example applications. Very, very neat. :)

1. Demo: [Typing Ninja](http://stcamp.net/games/t-ninja/)  Code: [https://github.com/MadRabbit/typing-ninja](https://github.com/MadRabbit/typing-ninja)
2. Demo: [Right Mines](http://stcamp.net/examples/r_mines/) Code: [https://github.com/MadRabbit/right-mines](https://github.com/MadRabbit/right-mines)

What's most interesting here is to read the code and notice how he is structuring the application.

These are the online resources I can remember off the top of my head. I'm sure there are more hidden treasures on the internets. :)
