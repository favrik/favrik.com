A few days ago, I was pointed to a project that generates CodeIgniter forms in an easy to use way, and a great looking interface: 
<a href="http://formigniter.org/">FormIgniter</a>. Basically, it is a form that creates forms :). As I am a <a href="http://blog.favrik.com/2007/11/23/forms-in-codeigniter-views/">form generation</a> freak,
 I immediatly checked it out.

If you are a frequent user of CodeIgniter, I believe FormIgniter can really save you time. Of course, it makes several assumptions that you may, or may not be in agreement with. I wonder if the source code is available some where.  You can find the CodeIgniter's forum discussion <a href="http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/111570/">here</a>.

Anyway, I exchanged some comments with the author, Oliver Rattue, and I think we agree that the next level in form generation is moving towards an active generator. I mentioned the possibility of using a DSL for creating forms (in a similar way that Haml is used for HTML), but so far it's just an idea. Let's see if I can find some "free" time. :D
