Having recently played through all the campaign mode of Halo 3 in cooperative mode with Rodrigo (he has no blog Alarm!), I can say the game was very entertaining, and the co-op mode just roxors (specially, when you play on a big LCD screen ^_^ &#8212; we played in the same room).

So we got new weapons, modified old weapons, and lots of vehicles; but even with that, it really felt like playing Halo 2 all over again. And I am refering only to the campaign mode.  Multiplayer is, and probably will, one of the best features of the Halo saga. <a href="http://bungie.com">Bungie's</a> multiplayer system totally beats the crap out of every other game available now. Seriously, respect.  And shame for the other games (cough coughcallofduty4cough cough).

<h2>Gamer recommendations</h2>
Since it's all about fun, my conclusion and advice is very logical: if you are a hardcore Halo fan, buy the game, and maybe don't bother playing the campaign (or play it if only to familiarize with the new system). 

If you have never played Halo, you could try it, as well as you could try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Call of Duty 4</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock">BioShock.</a> I have read some good comments about the last. Truth is, in the present time it's really hard to come up with something original regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">FPS</a>'s. I do wonder sometimes, who will initiate the revolution in this genre.

<h2>In closing</h2>
Things that irritated me about the Halo 3 campaign:
<ol>
<li>The use and abuse of the same visual effects to support the history.</li>
<li>Map reuse. At first funny, but then exasperating. Just when you get to the end of one map the next action sequence involves returning all the way back to where you started.</li>
<li>At the final chapters of the campaign, you could actually infer that the developer team was really tired of beating a dead horse. LOL!</li>
</ol>

Why I will keep playing the game:
<ol>
<li>Multiplayer.  I have played a good batch of FPS console games, none come close to Bungie's standard. It, pure and simple, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwns">pwns</a>.</li>
</ol>
