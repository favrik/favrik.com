Been listening to <a href="http://www.xrmradio.com">this</a> online station for about a week now. It's refreshing.  The music collection is not big and some notable played artists are: Alice in chains, Blink 182, Bush, Audioslave, Collective Soul, Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam, etc.  So now you have a pretty good idea of what kind of music this stations plays.

You can even register and make 2 song requests per hour (or is two hours?).  All the work, bandwidth, service; <strong>all</strong>, is <a href="http://www.xrmradio.com/about.php">provided</a> free of charge (as in free beer). Awesome!
