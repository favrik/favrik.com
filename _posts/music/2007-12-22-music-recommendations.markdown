It's hard to come up with <strong>great</strong> <em>new </em>music when you  have specific tastes, you don't listen to the radio, don't watch tv, and all you ever read is on the internet.  I feel a bit frustrated inside when asking a person what kind of music do they like, and they respond with the ambiguous "Everything", or "All types!"; but, later, they will modify that answer with some exceptions (they are inevitable, right?).  So, I'm thinking on rephrasing that question to: "What kind of music makes you want to leave the place immediately?".  Should work a lot better.

Anyway, since ancient times, word of mouth has been the best way, as in there is some implicit trust, to get in touch with a lot of varied things. In the case of music, I was very lucky to meet Luis Campos (he has no blog alarm!), which is very knowledgeable in music.  These are some of his recommendations with youtube videos:

<strong>Beirut </strong>- <em>Postcards from Italy</em>

Sharing music is a good thing. ^_^
