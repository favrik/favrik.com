The most interesting things I've found on the internet are the result of not looking for them.  

Perhaps, it's the unexpected reward of information or visual stimulus that makes me remember the experience as that, since there was no intent.  I could be predisposed to this kind of events though,  due to the fact that I browse the internet like a tourist. I'm always on vacation.

Today was such a day. I was signing up at <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">stumbleupon</a> then, after confirming my account by clicking on the email link, I unsuccessfully tried to change my password.  I don't know, I thought I was somewhat smart. I mean, my work requires doing some programming (not too deep); that should count for something!  

Must be the alcohol. >.>  So, having been defeated by the ninja link "change your password", I decided to check out the site. Clicking on videos produced this:
<object width="425" height="366"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7X9MQi7uOU&rel=0&border=0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/t7X9MQi7uOU&rel=0&border=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="366"></embed></object>
:D

I remembered visiting a site that linked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_stormtrooper">stormtroopers</a> with Japan. :D  Here's another video:
<object width="425" height="366"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bygdRMCwC6s&rel=1&border=0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bygdRMCwC6s&rel=1&border=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="366"></embed></object>

Visiting <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/all/eng/stormtrooper/">Danny Choo's blog</a>, I discovered the first video was done after a party with <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/blog_entry/eng/1199/Steve+Chen/">Steve Chen</a> (cofounder of <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> by the way), one of the persons attending at the party was <a href="http://www.kirainet.com">Hector</a>.  In his blog, I find a reference to "kancho".  <a href="http://www.kirainet.com/english/kancho/">What is kancho</a> you ask? You shouldn't have!

Lol.  So how did I went from a dancing stormtrooper to a <a href="http://kancho.org/">kancho</a> website?  

But wait, there is more...
