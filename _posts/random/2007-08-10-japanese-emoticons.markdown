It is possible that you have noticed some japanese style emoticons on the writings of this blog.  I'm loving them. One page that has a good variety is <a href="http://www.anikaos.com/japanese_emoticons.html">Anikaos</a>. I actually reserve some time from day to day to find about more variations.  

There is a direct relation here: since I like anime (a lot) I must like japanese emoticons. I do! (^o^)y  Oh well, I also like <a href="http://lolcats.com/">lolcats</a>.
