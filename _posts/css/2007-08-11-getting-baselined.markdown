Yes! I did it, it took a few hours but finally the old layout has been updated with a baseline (and partly a grid). It looks a lot better. <a href="/images/old.jpg">Image of previous style and layout</a>.  Main difficulty was to realize that the <em>em</em> is a relative unit depending on whatever base font size you set <strong>in an absolute unit</strong>. (*_*)

Time for some linkage:

</li>
</ul>

A long time ago, I read those tutorials. Today, I just woke up.  The inspiration came from a recent development: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">a CSS framework</a>.  To experience the beauty of having a baseline try <a href="http://robgoodlatte.com/2007/07/31/syncotype-your-baselines/">syncotype</a> and, for this site, set the line-height to 24px.   Syncotype rocks!

I will be playing with the style these days as there are some minor areas that need attention like: list spacing, form controls spacing, color scheme ...and that header. (Â¬_Â¬)
